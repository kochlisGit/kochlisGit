I am a graduated student of University of Ioannina with a master in Computer Science & Engineering. I am passionate about creating AI models to make predicitons and solve real-world problems. Some of the technologies that I enjoy working with include **Tensorflow & Keras** framework for deploying state-of-the-art DNNs and CNNs, as well as cutting-edge DRL agents. Also, I've become quite familiar with **OpenCV and SKlearn** libraries for Computer Vision and Data Processing after having done a lot of projects in my class, in my own and in **Kaggle's** competetions. Currently, I am doing research in Autonomous Vehicles, in which I deploy DRL algorithms to build self-driving cars in **Carla** simulator.
